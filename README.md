# <Weather Dashboard>

## Description

A weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

To practice and understand server-side api functions and coding syntax.

To expand my understanding of server-side api concepts and functionality.

if the user doesnt know the current weather for a paticular city this website will help you locate the weather for any city.

I learned how to request and activate a server api key and how to extract and store that data and how to configure that data to create the information being displayed in htmn via javascript functions.





## Usage

Open lick to web page. type city name to see the weather and a 5 day forecast
